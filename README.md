# cs101-csharp

A review of basic computer science problems related to data structures and algorithms.

As Stephen Covey might say, (were he a DotNet engineer with a bad sense of humor):

> An attempt to _c-sharpen_ the saw

🤡🎈🃏🤦🏻‍♂️

## Topics Covered

- string manipulation
- linked lists
- sorting algorithms
- math-based problems
- recursive vs. dynamic programming
- trees & binary search trees
- heaps
- tries
- graphs

## Why

I just finished a program of study of the contained topics in Javascript, the unofficial _lingua franca_ of programming.
I wanted more practice in the concepts I learned, but also wanted to practice the following:

- use the newest version of C# (currently 8.0)
- use the newest, cross-platform iteration of .Net, **.Net Core 3.0**
- try writing code without Visual Studio, using VS Code and the `dotnet` CLI
- practice TDD via the XUnit test suite

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need the .Net Core SDK for your platform, version 3.0 or higher.

You can get it directly:
[Download the .Net Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core)

It's also installed with the newest version of Visual Studio (currently 2019):
[Download Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

### Running

There is no main executable, just a library and tests...

### Learning

Someday maybe I will refactor this as a GitHub template repo, with the implementations blanked out, but for now I'm just going to implement my own answers. If you want to learn, you might delete my code and implement your own using my tests.

### Running the Tests

Navigate to the `/cs101Tests/` directory, and start the `dotnet` CLI's test runner

```text
PS C:\cs101-csharp\cs101Tests> dotnet test
```
